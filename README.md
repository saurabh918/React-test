# Book Management Website

This is a **React-based book management website** where users can view a list of books with features like searching and sorting. The application supports full **CRUD functionality** (Create, Read, Update, Delete), allowing users to manage books efficiently. State management is handled using **React Redux Toolkit**, and **Styled Components** are used for styling.

## Features

- **View Books**: Display a table of books with details like title, author, genre, and published year.
- **Search**: Users can search for books by title or other details.
- **Sorting**: Sort books by any column (e.g., title, author, published year) in both ascending and descending order.
- **Add New Books**: Users can add new books to the list.
- **Edit Books**: Edit the details of existing books, such as changing the title or author.
- **Delete Books**: Remove books from the collection with a delete feature.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes for optimal user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing components.
- **React Redux Toolkit**: For managing global state across the application, especially for handling the books data and CRUD actions.
- **Styled Components**: Used for creating modular and reusable styles within the components.
- **Axios or Fetch API**: For interacting with the backend API to perform CRUD operations on books (optional if you're using a backend).
